# Original requirements
You need to implement a backend for mobile and web applications to store and retrieve user data.
Mobile app will only send location data in JSON format:
```
{
    "userId": "2e3b11b0-07a4-4873-8de5-d2ae2eab26b2",
    "createdOn": "2022-02-08T11:44:00.524",
    "location": {
        "latitude": 52.25742342295784,
        "longitude": 10.540583401747602
    }
}
```
Suppose we have 100 active mobile app users, and each of them sends their location data every
minute of every day.
Web app will perform the following operations on this backend:
1. save or update user data:
```
{
   "userId": "2e3b11b0-07a4-4873-8de5-d2ae2eab26b2",
   "createdOn": "2022-02-08T11:44:00.524",
   "email": "alex.schmid@gmail.com",
   "firstName": "Alex",
   "secondName": "Schmid"
}
```
2. get user data with the latest location (if exists) by userId and response should be:
```
{
   "userId": "2e3b11b0-07a4-4873-8de5-d2ae2eab26b2",
   "createdOn": "2022-02-08T11:44:00.524",
   "email": "alex.schmid@gmail.com",
   "firstName": "Alex",
   "secondName": "Schmid",
   "location": {
       "latitude": 52.25742342295784,
       "longitude": 10.540583401747602
   }
}
```
3. get user locations by date time range and response should be:
```
{
   "userId": "2e3b11b0-07a4-4873-8de5-d2ae2eab26b2",
   "locations": [
       {
       "createdOn": "2022-02-08T11:44:00.524",
       "location": {
           "latitude": 52.25742342295784,
           "longitude": 10.540583401747602
       }},
       {
       "createdOn": "2022-02-08T12:05:00.124",
       "location": {
           "latitude": 52.25700491800493,
           "longitude": 10.528306568625961
       }}
   ]
}
```
Requests from the web app will be generated by user clicking in web-UI, which means that we will
have fewer incoming requests from the web app to our backend.\
The backend must be implemented using Spring / Micronaut, Java / Kotlin and other third-party
libraries are also allowed.\
It would be nice to have unit and integration tests and documentation such as Javadoc, readMe.md
etc.

# Missed requirements
1. What is the unique key for User entity?
2. Can be location of user updated?
3. Is change history in DB should be saved?
4. How many users should we be able to save in DB?
5. How many locations should we be able to save in DB?
6. How many rows should we be able to return in response on "get user locations" request?
7. Should we restrict requests by amount in unit of time in context of user/host?
